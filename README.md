# SortingComp

This was made for a university project, the program receives different sized, custom made, data and puts it through a bigger variety of sorting algorithms in order to create a rough estimation of the time required to run different sorts.

The program was made for personal use, thus it does not have many features, only a basic console UI and a simple console-printed output.

In order to run this program you will need to download the .exe and the "dataset" folder, put them in the same directory and run the executable, from there on select what list(s) you would like to run through the sorting algorithms and watch it do work. More info can be seen when opening the executable

Common errors: 

1. 
"msvcp144d.dll missing"

What is that dll? msvcp144d.dll is a "debug"-version of the file msvcp140. dll, and is used for "debugging" (software testing) during software development, thus having this file in your System32 / SysWOW64 is required.

Fix: Download the file from dll-files and put them in the required folders, lots of video tutorials can be found on youtube.

2. 
The folder "dataset" is missing

Fix: Make sure not to put the executable in the dataset folder.
