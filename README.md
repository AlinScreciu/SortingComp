# SortingComp

This was made for a university project, the program receives different sized, custom made, data and puts it through a bigger variety of sorting algorithms in order to create a rough estimation of the time required to run different sorts.

The program was made for personal use, thus it does not have many features, only a basic console UI and a simple console-printed output.
